# prework-study-guide# <Your-Project-Title>

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- My motivation was to push myself outside my comfortzone and see what undiscovered potentials that I might have and seeing that there are resources to help me with grey areas where I was struggling. I was determined to see the final result after series of failures.
- This project was built to reduce the fear of upcoming developers diving into the world of the unknown by giving them steps to follow if they encounter challenges while building a project.
- Bringing all information on one link that is needed to build a project from scratch with little or no experience.
- I learnt Debugging and testing errors.Having good eyes for details as wrong spellings can make your code not run, preservance, not giving up and eager to see the end result after so many errors from the start. .


## Installation

Ensure your laptop has a minimum of 8gb RAM and you have got good internet connection. Then you will need to download and install; git bash(this is run your command and link them to repo on github and vs-code), google chrome, also need vs-code to add data. 

## Usage

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative file path, add it to your README using the following syntax:
